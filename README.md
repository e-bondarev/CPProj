# CPProj

CPProj is an extension for Visual Studio Code that helps you create and manage C++ projects based on CMake.

## Features

* Fast project creation and setup
* Simple and fast creation of basic C++ entities (Classes and their files)
* Adding and managing dependencies (CPProj uses GitHub submodules and adds dependencies as sub-projects, which assures proper compilation)

## Requirements

CMake v3.12+

## Usage

1. Open a folder with VSCode where you want your project to be located.
Press F1, type in "CPProj" and press "Start new session".
2. Use the intiutive input fields to manipulate your project's settings.
3. Once you're satisfied with the settings, press "Create structure".
4. (In order to generate build files and compile the project I highly recommend using <a href="#">CMake Tools</a> extension.)
